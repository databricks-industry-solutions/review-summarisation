    "# Prompt Engineering\n",
    "We have prepped our data, and it is ready for summarisation. In this notebook, we are going to cover how we can create prompts to use with an LLM to summarise the reviews we have batched.\n",
    "\n",
    "There many, many models which we can pick and choose from in the open source community. Huggingface hosts most of these on their hub, and the great thing is, they have more or less standardised the way to interact with these models, so we can use most of them with slight changes to our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what should we pay attention to while choosing our model ?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, lets talk about model size. When you hear about a LLM, you would usually see that it comes with a parameter value. This can be something like 7 Billion parameters, 13, 30, 70, etc.. What does this mean ? This value tells us about how many configurable/trainable parameters a model has, which can tell us about its capacity to understand things. The bigger the model, the more complex tasks it can complete. However, as their size increase, so does their computation requirements: they tend to require more resources to operate. Therefore, picking the smallest size that can do the work is the best way to start. In our case, summarisation can be done by 7B models, so we are going to option for those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we need to pick a model which can follow instructions. What does that mean ? Lets take a look at two examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [MPT-7B-Base Model](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b)\n",
    "* [MPT-7B-Instruct Model](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mosaic's 7B Base model is a pre-trained model, however it has not been fine-tuned for a specific task. It would be a great candidate if we wanted to fine-tune it for a specific task which we have training data for. Where as the Instruct model has been trained on a Instructions dataset, and is more ready to follow instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given this, selecting the instruct model makes more sense, which we will cover in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets begin!"

The longer it gets, the more resources we are going to have to use to summarise. So, if the short answers suffice, we could option for those and get to spend less resources. However, if we want more details, then we can choose the performance trade-off.\n",
